         *this program is use to find any elemet in any row with variable array size
         *aplication of pointer is use in it
         *important point start from here to:
         *the index value of array can be go to 1 to 100000
         *check till array[1000]
         *end here
         *how to work example:
         **Question:
         ***number of array 2
         ***quarry 3
         ***array 1 is {1 2 3 4 5}
         ***array 2 is {6 7}
         ****i) what is 2nd element in 1st array
         ****ii) what is 1st element in 2nd array
         ****iii) what is 5th element in 1st array
         *****output:
         *****Enter Number of array you want to Store : 2
         *****Enter Number of Question or Quary you want to do Related to Array : 3
         *****Enter number of element in 1 rows : 5
         *****Enter the element of Array 1 2 3 4 5
         *****Enter number of element in 2 rows : 2
         *****Enter the element of Array 6 7
         *****enter the number of row which element You want to find : 1
         *****enter the position of element which You want to find : 2
         *****The element is 2
         *****enter the number of row which element You want to find : 2
         *****enter the position of element which You want to find : 1
         *****The element is 6
         *****enter the number of row which element You want to find : 1
         *****enter the position of element which You want to find : 5
         *****The element is 5
